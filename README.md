I sometimes enjoy having youtube in the background as I work, but with the ads and comments it can cause some lag.

So I decided to start making something that is estenially a youtube video player, but without all the other elements you won't need.

# Version 0.5

I released the first version, It's very barebones and lacks a lot of featues and quality of life, but it gets the job done.
