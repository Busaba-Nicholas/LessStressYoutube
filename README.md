I sometimes enjoy having youtube in the background as I work, but with the ads and comments it can cause some lag.

So I decided to start making something that is estenially a youtube video player, but without all the other elements you won't need.

# Version 0.8 (3/13/22)
 - Combined the "Replace Video by URL" and "Replace Video by ID" button
 - When replacing the video URL it accepts the ".../?v=<id>" format and the ".../<id>" format
 - Added placeholder text to the text inputs
 - Website can now be navigated with "tab" and "enter"
 - Start and end time for looping is now easier to read
 - Start and end time for looping now has a "clear" and "Replace with Current Time" button underneath for quality of life
 - Typing in a time supports "ddd:hh:mm:ss" format
 - Added Ability to move the video forward or backward 5, 10, and 15 seconds

# Version 0.5 (2/21/22)
I released the first version, It's very barebones and lacks a lot of featues and quality of life, but it gets the job done.
